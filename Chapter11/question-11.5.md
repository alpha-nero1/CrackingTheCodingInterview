# 11.5. How would you test a pen?
The problem is understanding the constraints of the situation at hand.

Who will be using it?
When will they be using it?
In what way will they be using it?
What will they be drawing on?

Remember that a good tester know exactly what he/she/they are testing before starting the work.

Now that we know that we can test the different components of the pen.

1. Fact check: verify that the pen is felt tip and the ink is one of the allowed colors.
2. Intended use: Drawing? does it write properly on clothing?
3. Intended use: does it wash off clothing, and in what intervals can you wash it off after?
2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days?
4. Safety: Is the pen toxic/non safe for children?
5. Unintended use: how else might children use the pen, stomp on it, chew it, throw it at a wall.
it must hold up under all of these conditions.

Note the essential categories that I tested here (FISU):
- Fact check.
- Intended use.
- Safety.
- Unintended.
