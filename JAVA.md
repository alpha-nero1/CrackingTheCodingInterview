# Java

To compile java files, exec `javac <path to file>`
Then execute the file using `java <classname>`

Notes on JAVA.
- To run a simple program you need to write a class containing the `public static void main(String[] args)` function.

- Concat in string is done with `+` e.g. System.out.println("a" + b + "c");

- Java leans towards use of functions instead of simple variable accessing. E.g `myString.length()`, `myString.charAt(0)`

- It of course requires compilation then execution of the class.

- Cannot for in loop string chars.

- to get length of string use `.length()` for length of array use the property `.length`

- System.out.println can ONLY take a string.
