# System Design and Scalability

## Handling these types of questions:
- Communicate about the solution as you go.
- Go broad first and start high level, not algorithm level.
- Use the whiteboard to demonstrate design.
- Acknowledge interviewer concerns.
- Be careful about assumptions, these could dramatically change your solution.
- State your assumptions explicitly.
- Estimate when necessary if you do not have the data you need.
- Drive

## System design step by step.
1. **Scope the problem**, you'll want to know exactly what you'll need to implement. Make a list of the major features/use cases.
2. **Make reasonable assumptions**, for instance it may be reasonable to assume a design for a max of 1 million daily users so you know how much storage you need.
3. **Draw the major components**, go to the whiteboard and draw your system out.
4. **Identify key issues**,
