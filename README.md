# Cracking The Coding Interview.
https://github.com/alpha-nero1/CrackingTheCodingInterview
&nbsp;
In this folder I will complete all 189 of cracking the coding interviews algorithms. My main language for doing so is JavaScript. For bonus points I will include the same solutions in different languages.

&nbsp;

Questions will be answered in:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Swift
- C#
- C++

I will mainly work in JavaScript but I am committing now to do a solution in all other languages "AT LEAST" once a week.

In that order of priority ^

- Revisit 1.7, the swapping hath confused me greatly.

Goals:
- Create hashtable implmentation in each language. JS ✅, PY ✅, Swift ✅, Java ✅, C# ✅, C++ ✅


Core Progress (3 questions from each chapter):
- Remember that chapters 1-8 have been done to completion.
- 31 / 51 (60.7)
- 34 / 51 (66.6)

## Nice VSCode shortcuts.
- `home`: cursor to start of line.
- `end`: cursor to end of line.
- `ctl + l`: highlight current line.
- `shift + alt + down`: copy same line down.
