# Cracking The Coding Interview.
https://github.com/alpha-nero1/CrackingTheCodingInterview
&nbsp;
In this folder I will complete all 189 of cracking the coding interviews algorithms. My main language for doing so is JavaScript. For bonus points I will include the same solutions in different languages.

&nbsp;

Questions will be answered in:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Swift
- C#
- C++

I will mainly work in JavaScript but I am committing now to do a solution in all other languages "AT LEAST" once a week.

In that order of priority ^

- Revisit 1.7, the swapping hath confused me greatly.

Goals:
- Create hashtable implmentation in each language. JS ✅, PY ✅, Swift ✅, Java ✅, C# ✅, C++ ✅

Progress:
(If marked with redo means I struggled and should do again in another lang to solidify understanding)
- Chapter 1 ✅
- Chapter 2 ✅
- Chapter 3.3 ✅
- Chapter 3.4 ✅
- Chapter 3.5 ✅
- Chapter 3.6 ✅
- 4.1 ✅ 
- 4.2 ✅ - needed help, do in JS [✅]
- 4.3 ✅
- 4.4 ✅ - do in py [✅].
- 4.5 ✅ - do in swift [✅].
- 4.6 - 4.12 ✅ (4.12 optimal solution was confusing, re-address later.)

Notes:
- Understand the chapter concepts before beginning the questions. If it gives you implementations of data structures or common algorithms, implement them yourself and make sure you get how it all works and flows. Otherwise, you will struggle with the questions for sure.
