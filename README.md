# Cracking The Coding Interview.
https://github.com/alpha-nero1/CrackingTheCodingInterview
&nbsp;
In this folder I will complete all 189 of cracking the coding interviews algorithms. My main language for doing so is JavaScript. For bonus points I will include the same solutions in different languages.

&nbsp;

Questions will be answered in:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Swift
- C#
- C++

I will mainly work in JavaScript but I am committing now to do a solution in all other languages "AT LEAST" once a week.

In that order of priority ^

- Revisit 1.7, the swapping hath confused me greatly.

Goals:
- Create hashtable implmentation in each language. JS ✅, PY ✅, Swift ✅, Java ✅, C# ✅, C++ ✅

Progress:
(If marked with redo means I struggled and should do again in another lang to solidify understanding)
- Chapter 1 ✅
- Chapter 2 ✅
- Chapter 3.3 ✅
- Chapter 3.4 ✅
- Chapter 3.5 ✅
