# ⌨️ Cracking The Coding Interview.
In this project I will complete all 189 of the cracking the coding interview's algorithms.
I also include a handy `Core` folder with great common/useful/awesome programming implementations
like hashtables, linked lists, core sorting/searching algos and much more.

### Questions will be answered in:
- Python
- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- Swift
- C++

Questions will mainly be done in JavaScript, Python and C# as they are awesome languages (and the ones I find have the most use to me). I will, however, occasionally dabble in Java, Swift and C++ as they are important but I wouldn't find myself using them on the day-to-day.

## ⚠️ Algo Tips
- Everything is figureoutable, take your time, understand the question and if you need help, reference the answers, it's a learning process anyway.
- Do just a bit each day, there are too many questions here to worry about in large chunks.
- It's a long road, just remember, it is a process.
- The chapter introductions have really good information on the topics before you go into them, it is essential to have some notes on these and understand key concepts before running head first into the problems.

## ✅ Core Progress (3 questions from each chapter)
Because it is a large book, the goals of completion have been split into 2.
The first is to get the "Core" out of the way (3 questions from each chapter). The second
is to finish off the rest.
- Remember that chapters 1-8 have been done to completion.
- 31 / 51 (60.7)
- 34 / 51 (66.6)
- 42 / 51 (78.8)
- 48 / 51 (94.1)
- 51 / 51 (100) !!!

## ✅ Total Progress
first 7 chapters progress = 9 + 8 + 6 + 12 + 8 + 10 + 9 = 62
- 62 + 11 = 73 / 189 (38.6)
- 62 + 48 - 21 = 89 / 189 (47.0)
- 62 + 51 - 21 = 92 / 189 (48.6)
- 94 / 189 (49.7) (includes 8.4 and 8.5)
- 98 / 189 (51.8) (invludes 8.9)
- 99 / 189 (52.3) (includes 8.10)
- 100 / 189 (52.9) (includes 8.11)
- 101 / 189 (53.4) (includes 8.12)
- 108 / 189 (57.1) (includes 9.8)
- 112 / 189 (59.2) (includes 10.6 + 11.4)
- 117 / 189 (61.9) (includes 10.11)
- 121 / 189 (64.0) (includes 12.5)
- 123 / 189 (65.0) (includes 12.7)
- 129 / 189 (68.2) (includes 13.5)
- 136 / 189 (71.9) (includes 15.3)
- 141 / 189 (74.6) (includes 16.4)
- 144 / 189 (76.1) (includes 16.7)
- 149 / 189 (78.8) (includes 16.12)

## Nice VSCode shortcuts.
- `home`: cursor to start of line.
- `end`: cursor to end of line.
- `ctl + l`: highlight current line.
- `shift + alt + down`: copy same line down.
