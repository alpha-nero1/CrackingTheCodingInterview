# Cracking The Coding Interview.

In this folder I will complete all 189 of cracking the coding interviews algorithms. My main language for doing so is JavaScript. For bonus points I will include the same solutions in different languages.

&nbsp;

Questions will be answered in:
- JavaScript
- Python
- Java
- Swift
- C#
- C++

I will mainly work in JavaScript but I am committing now to do a solution in all other languages "AT LEAST" once a week.

In that order of priority ^

- Revisit 1.7, the swapping hath confused me greatly.
