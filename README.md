# Cracking The Coding Interview.
https://github.com/alpha-nero1/CrackingTheCodingInterview
&nbsp;
In this folder I will complete all 189 of cracking the coding interviews algorithms. My main language for doing so is JavaScript. For bonus points I will include the same solutions in different languages.

Questions will be answered in:
- Python
- JavaScript
- C#
- Java
- Swift
- C++

Questions will mainly be done in JavaScript, Python and C# as they are awesome languages (and the ones I find have the most use to me). I will, however, occasionally dabble in Java, Swift and C++ as they are important but I wouldn't find myself using them on the day-to-day.

## Goals:
- Create hashtable implmentation in each language. JS ✅, PY ✅, Swift ✅, Java ✅, C# ✅, C++ ✅


## Core Progress (3 questions from each chapter):
- Remember that chapters 1-8 have been done to completion.
- 31 / 51 (60.7)
- 34 / 51 (66.6)
- 42 / 51 (78.8)
- 48 / 51 (94.1)

## Total Progress.
first 7 chapters progress = 9 + 8 + 6 + 12 + 8 + 10 + 9 = 62
- 62 + 11 = 73 / 189 (38.6)
- 62 + 48 - 21 = 89 / 189 (47.0)

## Nice VSCode shortcuts.
- `home`: cursor to start of line.
- `end`: cursor to end of line.
- `ctl + l`: highlight current line.
- `shift + alt + down`: copy same line down.
