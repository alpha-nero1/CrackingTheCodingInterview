/*
    Jump search involves finding first a chunk that we want to search in the array
    then doing a linear search on that chunk. Time complexity is O(âˆšn)

    "Binary Search is better than Jump Search, but Jump Search has the
    advantage that we traverse back only once (Binary Search may require up to O(Log n) jumps,
    consider a situation where the element to be searched is the smallest element or
    just bigger than the smallest). So, in a system where binary search is costly,
    we use Jump Search."

    Performed on sorted algorithms.
